    <h1>Booting</h1>
    <p>
    The OS uses a simple bootloader in the MBR of the disk. It was not designed for
    compatibility; I haven't tested it on any other VM software, other than QEMU.
    </p>

    <p>
    The bootloader does a few things, in this order:

    <ol>
        <li>Disable interrupts</li>
        <li>
        Print an 'x' to the console (in QEMU, this is represented in the serial
        console, not the VGA display)
        </li>
        <li>
        Find drive c and copy its contents into memory starting <code>loadKernelHere</code>,
        which is defined in <code>mbr.S</code>
        </li>
        <li>
        If the kernel is longer 64KB (I think), the BIOS instruction used to copy the
        kernel to memory returns an error and only copies the first 64KB. This caused
        very arcane, hard-to-trace errors later on, so instead, if the kernel is
        longer than 64KB, the bootloader prints 'e' and hangs. This could be easily
        fixed by writing a better bootloader, but I want to do more interesting
        things.
        </li>
        <li>Do a long jump to start the kernel.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
    All of this is defined in <code>mbr.S</code>. <code>mbr.S</code> also defines the GDT, IDT, TSS
    table descriptor, and the various segments. These variables are global and can
    be used elsewhere in the OS source.
    </p>

    <h1>Kernel startup</h1>

    <p>
    The <code>kernel_main</code> function in <code>lib.rs</code> is the Rust entry point of the kernel; it
    is the first Rust code to run. The function initialized kernel subsystems in the
    following order:

    <ol>
        <li>Initialize the kernel heap manager</li>
        <li>Initialize physical memory management</li>
        <li>Create the init and idle processes</li>
        <li>Initialize the PIC</li>
        <li>Initialize the PIT</li>
        <li>Start the init process</li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
    Starting the init process accomplishes a few things. First, it turns on interrupts
    for the first time. Second, it turns on virtual memory for the first time. Third,
    it is the first real process to run in the system, allowing it to spawn other
    processes.
    </p>

    <h1>Processes and Scheduling</h1>

    <p>
    Processes have a

    <ul>
        <li>Unique 32-bit PID</li>
        <li>Rust string representing the name (not necessarily unique, but it helps with
        debugging)</li>
        <li>2048-word kernel-mode stack allocated on the kernel heap (this stack is not used
        when the process is in user-mode)</li>
        <li>Context struct representing the context at which the process was interrupted
        (only valid if the process is NOT running)</li>
        <li>AddressSpace struct with a pointer to that process's page directory</li>
        <li>A function pointer to the process's routine (specified at process creation)</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
    Unfortunately, because processes are allocated on the kernel heap, Rust wil not
    allow them to use closures instead of function pointers. It would be nice if we
    could have each process contain a dynamically bound call using the <code>FnOnce</code> trait
    (essentially a thunk), but <code>FnOnce</code>'s <code>call</code> method moves the <code>FnOnce</code> out of the
    process, which is not allowed because process is heap allocated and has a
    destructor. There is an open RFC about the <code>Box<FnBox></code> constuct, which would allow
    the desired behavior, but it is not working yet. If this RFC was implemented, we
    would be able to create processes like so:
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-rust">
    let resource = Arc::new(Semaphore::new(foo));
    let r = resource.clone();
    process::make_ready(Process::new("bar_proc", move |this| {
        println!("{:?} says {}", this, r.down());
    }));
    </code></pre>

    <p>
    Processes are round-robin scheduled, according to the order in which
    <code>process::make_ready</code> is called. A process can yield the rest of its quantum by
    calling <code>process::proc_yield</code>. os1 uses preemptive multiprocessing based on the
    PIT. This is largely invisible from the point of view of processes, though.
    </p>

    <h1>Kernel Memory</h1>

    <p>
    From the point of view of the kernel, memory is split up into 3 sections. The first
    megabyte of memory consists of the kernel code, the vga buffer, and various
    constants. The next 3MB of memory contain the kernel heap. The following 4MB of
    memory contain the mappable physical memory frames. These first 8MB of memory are
    direct mapped for convenience. So far, only 8MB of physical memory are actually used.
    I plan to improve this so that all of physical memory is available.
    </p>

    <h2>Heap</h2>

    <p>
    The kernel heap is used for kernel data structures only; when a process switches to
    user-mode, its heap and stack are mapped to physical memory frames via page tables.
    The kernel heap is a first-fit heap implementation with block coalescing and splitting.
    In my implementation, each free block has a 3-word header consisting of the size of the
    block and forward and backward pointers to other free blocks, along with some flags.
    Each block has a footer than consists only of the size of the block.
    </p>

    <p>
    Because the Rust compiler is the only entity making calls to allocate or free memory,
    less sanity checking and metadata is necessary than normal. This allows some
    simplifying assumptions and gives the heap implementation some nice properties that
    are not often possible in C:

    <ul>
        <li>
        Used blocks have no metadata at all. The compiler makes calls to <code>free</code>, passing in
        the size of the block in addition to a pointer to the block. This means that we always
        know as much information as we need to add a block to the free list and find the
        next block to merge with it if it is free. The compiler guarantees that calls to free
        will only be for legitimate used blocks.
        </li>
        <li>All blocks are an exact multiple of <code>4*WORD_SIZE</code> in size.</li>
        <li>All blocks are <code>(4*WORD_SIZE)</code>-byte-aligned.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
    This allows for easy sanity checking and alignment guarantees, while there is also no
    overhead for metadata.
    </p>

    <h2>Physical memory</h2>

    <p>
    At the moment, the 4MB of frames that are direct mapped are all the physical memory
    available for use by processes. This will be fixed soon.
